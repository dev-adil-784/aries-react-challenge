# Options Breakeven Calculation

When trading options, understanding the breakeven points is crucial for assessing profitability and risk. This guide explains how to calculate breakeven points for both call and put options, considering both long and short positions.

## Long Positions

### Long Call Option

A long call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at the strike price. The trader pays a premium for this option.

**Breakeven Price for Long Call Option:**
\[ \text{Breakeven Price} = \text{Strike Price} + \text{Premium Paid} \]

### Long Put Option

A long put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at the strike price. The trader pays a premium for this option.

**Breakeven Price for Long Put Option:**
\[ \text{Breakeven Price} = \text{Strike Price} - \text{Premium Paid} \]

## Short Positions

### Short Call Option

A short call option obligates the trader to sell the underlying asset at the strike price if exercised. The trader receives a premium for taking on this obligation.

**Breakeven Price for Short Call Option:**
\[ \text{Breakeven Price} = \text{Strike Price} + \text{Premium Received} \]

### Short Put Option

A short put option obligates the trader to buy the underlying asset at the strike price if exercised. The trader receives a premium for taking on this obligation.

**Breakeven Price for Short Put Option:**
\[ \text{Breakeven Price} = \text{Strike Price} - \text{Premium Received} \]
